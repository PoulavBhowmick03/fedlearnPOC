# Proof of Concept: On-Chain Federated Learning Platform with Proof of Stake Consensus

## Introduction

In the era of data-driven technologies, the privacy of user data is a critical concern. Traditional centralized machine learning models require aggregating large volumes of sensitive data, often leading to privacy and security issues. Federated learning offers a solution by decentralizing the training process, ensuring that user data remains on local devices. This proof of concept (PoC) outlines the implementation of an on-chain federated learning platform using a proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The platform leverages blockchain technology to enhance security, transparency, and incentivization.

## What is Federated Learning?

Federated learning is a machine learning approach where model training is distributed across multiple devices or servers. Instead of sending raw data to a central server, each client device trains the model locally on its own data and shares only the updated model parameters with the central server. The central server aggregates these updates to refine the global model.

### Key Features of Federated Learning

- **Data Privacy**: User data remains on local devices, ensuring privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for extensive data transfer and storage.
- **Scalability**: Can accommodate a large number of participants.

## Role and Importance of Federated Learning

Federated learning addresses several critical issues in traditional machine learning:

- **Privacy Concerns**: By keeping data local, federated learning minimizes the risk of data breaches and misuse.
- **Data Ownership**: Users retain control over their data, fostering trust and participation.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps organizations comply with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

## Why Web3 is Crucial for This Project

Web3, the decentralized web, plays a vital role in enhancing federated learning:

- **Decentralization**: Blockchain ensures a decentralized and trustless environment, eliminating the need for a central authority.
- **Security**: Blockchain's immutable ledger provides a secure record of transactions and model updates.
- **Incentivization**: Smart contracts enable automated and transparent reward distribution for participants.
- **Transparency**: All transactions and model updates are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## Workflow of Our Project

### Organization Side

#### Step 1: Registration

- Register and upload their client.py file, linked to a global model hosted on a cloud platform. The file is deployed on IPFS (using Pinata) and includes a token deposit to reward users.

#### Step 2: Model Upload

- Organizations set a reward pool and a deadline for model training.
- The client.py file is linked to the global model and made available on the platform.

### User Side

#### Step 1: Registration

- Register using their cryptocurrency wallets, creating a secure and verifiable identity.

#### Step 2: Participation

- Users browse available models and stake tokens to participate in the training process.
- Upon successful staking, users download the client.py file and run it locally to train the model.

#### Step 3: Training and Parameter Aggregation

- Users train the model on their local devices using their own data.
- The client.py file updates the model parameters and sends them to the central server.
- The central server aggregates the parameters to update the global model.

#### Step 4: Reward Distribution

- Users submit their wallet addresses (encrypted and hashed using SHA-256) to the frontend via WebSockets in real-time.
- The system verifies the wallet addresses and distributes rewards from the organization's deposit to the successful participants.
